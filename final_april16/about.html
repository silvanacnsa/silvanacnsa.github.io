                        <p>At the end of the year 2023, Montreal Gazette health reporter, Aaron Derfel, concluded that the Quebec
                            healthcare system is “arguably the worst it's ever been”.</p>

                    <p>A critical issue is a significant shortage of
                        general practitioners, a problem exacerbated by physicians who retire, enter private practice, or leave
                        the province altogether. In December 2023, around 14,000 patients had been waiting over a year for
                        surgery (Derfel), and the previous year, over 800,000 Quebec residents were on the waitlist for a family
                        physician (Ha).</p>
                    <p>There are many reasons why Quebec's healthcare system is in its current state. In 2019, Quebec
                        experienced a 52 percent deficit in the number of physicians per capita compared to the average observed
                        in other high-income countries with healthcare systems funded by universal taxpayer contributions
                        (Shaw). Also, Quebec universities refuse more than 9,500 applicants per year to their medical faculties,
                        capping the number of students admitted to 966 a year (Shaw). Additionally, for nearly 30 years, general
                        practitioners have had to do compulsory shifts in hospitals and other facilities that are short-staffed,
                        leaving a lack of physicians working in primary care (Ha). According to the Montreal Gazette, for
                        Quebec's health network to resume functioning properly, there needs to be an increase of at least 12,425
                        more workers.</p>

                <h3>Self Diagnosis and Social Media</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>There is a concerning rising trend of young adults, relying on social media, and the Internet for
                        self-diagnosing psychiatric disorders (Cohen). According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, mental health
                        professionals are observing an increase in patients diagnosing themselves with various disorders or
                        illnesses after watching social media creators share the symptoms of their health issues. This lack of
                        professional guidance in these self-diagnosis can lead to misinformation and potentially harmful
                        consequences, for example, an individual may conclude that they are suffering from depression, based on
                        symptoms found online, but they could be experiencing hypothyroidism or a certain vitamin deficiency
                        (Cohen).</p>
                    <p>This surge in self-diagnosis through internet sources may be partially attributed to the accessibility
                        challenges of the healthcare system. With a growing number of individuals facing barriers to accessing
                        timely and affordable healthcare, people are turning to the Internet for answers to their health
                        concerns (Bregel). The limited availability of healthcare professionals, long wait times, and a shortage
                        of accessible health services contribute to the appeal of online information.</p>

                <h3>Website Concept</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>In a time where securing a timely doctor's appointment can be a challenging task and waitlists seem
                        endless, the website is a mock medical site intended to comment on the growing trend of self-diagnosis. This platform serves
                        as a reference for those who don't have access to professional medical care and turn to the internet to
                        get answers, offering lists of mundane symptoms and exaggerated and inaccurate diagnoses to hyperbolize the effect of getting medical advice online. We've all had an experience where we've googled a few of our symptoms and the results have ranged from a simple cold to an emergency situation.</p>
                    <p>The website addresses the serious issue of delayed medical attention and the resulting rise in
                        self-diagnosis. By presenting absurd scenarios, the aim is to shed light on the challenges individuals
                        face in accessing timely and accurate healthcare. The content within the website delves into the
                        consequences of a healthcare system under strain, where individuals choose to seek information
                        independently, even if it means entertaining inaccurate or exaggerated results.</p>
